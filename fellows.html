		                free time hunting down original muscle car parts, as he works
		                towards re-building a 1967 Pontiac Firebird 400. The hobby has
		                forced him to appreciate patience and to learn to channel

		                freeway in Los Angeles, because for some reason, the clutch
		                pedal has fallen to the floor. Majoring in Economics and
		                Finance at Claremont McKenna, Brentt had the opportunity to
		                embark on a two-week community building trip to Honduras,
		                living with a host family. In addition, he was Captain and MVP
		                of the 2010 Division II National Champion Rugby team.</a>

		                with a local start-up to fulfill a major requirement. This
		                experience at a young tech company – paired with a short stint

		                Ultimately, she traded in Silicon Valley for Cincinnati &amp;
		                VFA, which provided her with what she was missing before: a

		                <a>Eleanor graduated with honors in 2012 with a bachelor’s
		                degree in Public Policy and International Affairs. A passionate
		                problem-solver, Eleanor spent most of her college summers
		                working in Tanzania and South Africa where she learned from
		                slum dwellers about the art and struggle of providing
		                microfinance and organizing for better public services, access
		                to loans, and political voice. Curious about the unintended
		                consequences of grant-based funding, she interviewed
		                non-profits across Malawi for her senior thesis to understand
		                how they accessed funding and its effect on their relationship
		                with government. On campus, she spearheaded the creation of
		                “The Real Food Co-op,” a student communal cooking and dining
		                cooperative, founded “Lotus Cafe,” a weekly wine-and-tea-filled
		                dialogue for students to discuss personal and community issues,
		                and partnered with fellow students to incite a campus-wide
		                mental health movement. After graduation, she co-authored a
		                paper that develops a framework for understanding how different
		                types of technology-enabled networks can be harnessed for
		                international development. She then became a research associate
		                at the Rockefeller Foundation. She loves capoeira, trying new
		                foods, and good conversation.</a>

		                Leadership Program. Her childhood hiking mountains in the
		                Seattle area drew her attention early to sustainability issues.
		                She has since spent a year lobbying for environmental education
		                in DC and biked across the country to study national energy
		                concerns. Recently she led a delegation representing US Youth
		                to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Doha, Qatar
		                through SustainUS. After Kate spent a semester with a
		                “micro-consignment” startup in Nicaragua, she became passionate
		                about social enterprise and the private sector as a solution to
		                address societal ills while creating jobs. Kate enjoys
		                exploring new trails, countries, street food and
		                microbrews.</a>

		                minored in Chinese. When she was not playing for the Women’s
		                Ultimate Frisbee Team, memorizing Chinese characters or giving
		                tours to prospective students, Astrid could be found fulfilling

		                it combines her passions for athletics and energy awareness,
		                and convinced her that she wants to run her own business. After
		                graduating, she decided to stay at Middlebury for a year to
		                support and recruit for MiddCORE, an amazing summer course on

		                <a>Shilpi (@_shilpikumar) aspires to be a game-changer. After
		                hearing Andrew Yang speak at the DNC, she decided to pursue
		                entrepreneurship and couldn’t be more excited to join VFA. At
		                Duke, Shilpi took an interdisciplinary approach to studying
		                human decision-making, with a focus on neuroscience and
		                economics — but really spent most of her time over-committing
		                to student organizations and creating life-long friendships.
		                She has worked for a social media firm in Paris, a blog
		                advertising startup in Durham, and the UN Women office in
		                Reykjavik. Most recently, Shilpi was an advertising operations
		                summer intern at LinkedIn. Shilpi is passionate about
		                revitalizing American cities, bolstering corporate social
		                responsibility, and creating substantive leadership
		                opportunities for women.</a>

		                <a>At Cornell Alex studied History with a focus on
		                International Relations and the Cold War, but he did most of
		                his learning in the various business he was a part of and as a
		                leader in the storied Cornell Greek system. He worked on the
		                business team of the Cornell Daily Sun; was Operations Manager
		                for Ithaca’s largest full service shipping and storage company,
		                Big Red Shipping and Storage; and served as the Business
		                Manager for the Cornellian yearbook. As the Vice President of
		                Recruitment for the Interfraternity Council Alex worked to
		                promote the positive values and lessons of Greek life in the
		                face of growing national criticism. When he wasn’t working, you
		                could find Alex in the gym, on the basketball court, or
		                relaxing at his second home overlooking Cayuga Lake, Sigma

		                <a>Alex majored in Mathematics and Economics at Middlebury
		                College. He spent two summers creating sustainable fishing
		                models at the Caltech Department of Economics, and he interned
		                with a startup incubator called the Vermont Center for Emerging
		                Technologies. When Alex isn’t meeting with entrepreneurs, he’s
		                working on Jiminy, his project that produces cricket-infused
		                energy bars that give children the protein and iron they need.
		                Each bar purchased helps fund cricket farms in Kenya that give
		                these same critical nutrients to children that need them
		                dearly. In his spare time, Alex enjoys playing volleyball and

		                he majored in Environmental Science and minoring in Marine
		                Science. A Cary native, she discovered her passion for
		                sustainability through her interactions with local
		                decision-makers in the field and her fascination with the
		                endless connections between human actions and natural
		                processes. In addition to participating in multiple research
		                experiences, including an honors thesis in bacterial ecology
		                and a month-long research cruise, she is interested in social
		                issues, conducting outreach for a poverty eradication
		                organization and chairing an environmental justice
		                organization. Last summer, she developed a youth education
		                program for a community that has lived for decades with a
		                municipal landfill in its backyard with the goal of developing
		                the next generation of scientists and community activists. As a
		                four-term Sustainability Office intern, she helped manage the
		                office’s outreach and events and loved to network with student
		                and departmental leaders. Her other interests include SCUBA
		                diving, spontaneous road trips, reading long novels, and sewing
		                her own clothes.</a>

		                Information Systems. He is a native of Southern California
		                where he was fortunate to spend the majority of his life
		                outdoors, especially on the baseball fields. After moving east
		                for college and embracing the differences in climate, culture,
		                and history, Maxwell is constantly seeking new life
		                experiences. He believes that the value of these experiences
		                lives in the more nuanced perspective with which one sees the
		                world, work, and life everyday. His time in college has been
		                one of self-discovery, where he cultivated his belief in the
		                power of entrepreneurship, environmentally sustainable
		                initiatives, and the importance of informed conversations on
		                the problems facing society. Through his experience working at
		                start-up companies and at home with his family, Max has found
		                the most fulfillment from work in the development of an idea
		                from inception to realization. His free time is spent listening
		                to and discovering music, reading, playing pick-up games of any
		                sport, practicing yoga and exploring.</a>

		                <a>Born in Washington, DC, Eli moved to Winston-Salem, North
		                Carolina, when he was eleven years old. He attended R.J.
		                Reynolds High School and was elected class president for three
		                consecutive years. He majored in economics at Haverford
		                College, where he played on the varsity basketball team every
		                year. Eli’s senior thesis investigates the relationship between
		                athletic motivation and labor market outcomes, measured by
		                income and employment status. Eli recognized his passion for
		                entrepreneurship this past summer while working for Brad
		                Aronson, a successful young businessman who hired Eli to use
		                SEO and social media campaigns to drive traffic to his startup
		                blog, bradaronson.com. Eli’s immersion into the Philadelphia
		                startup community led him to attend a Hackathon event where he
		                competed on a team of entrepreneurs to develop a business and
		                win seed money. His growing interest in entrepreneurship led
		                him to work for an education startup (LLESSInc) and an
		                innovative basketball-specific apparel startup (POINT3). Eli
		                was also a mentor for Startup Corps, teaching high school
		                students about entrepreneurship and coaching them as they
		                develop their own businesses. He recently began working with
		                two of his friends to develop an iPhone application and looks
		                forward to developing more innovative endeavors as a
		                Fellow.</a>

		                <a>Kate graduated from Vanderbilt University where she majored
		                in Human and Organizational Development and French and the
		                Creative Arts. Having aspired to be everything from a Food
		                Network star to a travel photographer, she could not be more
		                excited to join VFA and channel the inner entrepreneur that she
		                has always dreamed to be. Spending her past two summers
		                interning at Ernst &amp; Young and Warner Music Group, her
		                Vanderbilt days have involved everything from writing for the
		                student newspaper to being social chair of her sorority to
		                co-founding a company, HeyBazaar, which serves as a unique
		                classifieds website for members of the Vanderbilt community.
		                With a love for photography, you can often find her people
		                watching in coffee shops or roaming the streets capturing
		                photos to add to her portfolio. In her free time, she enjoys
		                sampling at Whole Foods, kickboxing, and reading music
		                blogs.</a>

		                <a>Claire studied Social Studies at Harvard University. Though

		                after a six month gig working as a community organizer for a
		                New Hampshire congressional campaign in 2010. Since then, she
		                has developed an internship program for Senator Elizabeth
		                Warren’s campaign and produced materials and social media
		                content for Rootstrikers, an organization that seeks to combat
		                political corruption caused by special interest money. At
		                Harvard, Claire invested most of her time in various public
		                service organizations, though she also worked as a tour guide,
		                led backpacking trips for freshmen, and was a member of Delta

		                <a>Andrew is studying biomedical engineering at the University
		                of Virginia, where he gained experience in undergraduate
		                research and device design. After a bit of soul searching,
		                Andrew discovered his true passion for agriculture and
		                sustainability during his third year and has since shifted his
		                focus from medical school to agriculture. He spent the
		                following summer interning on a permaculture and biodynamic
		                farm in Accomac, VA, where his passion only deepened. Upon
		                returning for his final year, Andrew decided to pursue a
		                capstone project that merged his newfound interest with
		                biomedical engineering, while also solving a large real world
		                problem. His research assessed the effectiveness of treating
		                human waste with black soldier fly larvae for use in developing
		                countries around the world. Andrew’s ultimate career goal is to
		                own and operate his own diversified alternative farm by 2020.
		                In his spare time, Andrew spends his free time cooking,
		                reading, homebrewing, working on personal projects and spending
		                time outdoors.</a>

		                <a>Avery will graduate from Cornell University with a degree in

		                humanities, he gained a variety of business experiences outside
		                of the classroom. Before starting college, he founded an
		                environmental non-profit in his hometown of New York City. The
		                charity, RelightNY, received both local and national attention

		                business development. Over the past three summers, Avery has
		                worked for companies ranging from international firms to
		                early-stage startups. In 2011, he interned for Alloy in branded
		                content. The following year, Avery worked as an account planner
		                at JWT, a global ad agency, where he helped clients engage
		                their millennial audience. This past summer, Avery pursued his
		                passion for filmmaking, working part-time as a video production
		                assistant for VICE on HBO. The very same summer, Avery worked
		                in content creation at Tapestry, a start-up app company out of
		                the New York based tech incubator, Betaworks. While he is not
		                honing his creative and marketing skills on the job, Avery
		                enjoys playing piano and basketball.</a>

		                <a>Courtney is motivated by a passion to spur economic
		                development by building innovative organizations that drive
		                social change. While studying public policy and economics, she
		                developed her desire to pursue a change-making career in
		                entrepreneurship by working with rural businesswomen in South
		                Africa, supporting bilateral entrepreneurship at the U.S.
		                Department of State, and starting a partnership for young women
		                to help local entrepreneurs spark business growth. At Duke, she
		                served on the student newspaper’s Editorial Board, was a
		                teaching assistant, and wrote an honors thesis on the
		                relationship between women’s economic empowerment and political
		                representation. Courtney strongly believes in the power of
		                entrepreneurship to revitalize American cities and is excited
		                by VFA’s commitment to this mission.</a>

		                <a>Dan hails from Portsmouth, Rhode Island, and is studying
		                English and Economics at Boston College. A proud Eagle while on
		                the Heights, Dan captained the Men’s Lacrosse team and led a
		                service-immersion trip to Nicaragua. Dan’s entrepreneurial
		                foundation stems from The Odd Job Service, a company he started
		                with his best buddy from back home. The company, whose tag-line
		                is “Tall, Dark, and Hands-On,” did everything from landscaping
		                to moving, and showed substantial growth over three summers by
		                expanding to 5 employees and working for over 300 clients.
		                While The Odd Job Service has defined a large piece of his work
		                experience, Dan also enjoys the pursuit of knowledge and
		                cultivation of beliefs in and outside of the classroom. Dan is
		                always looking to push his boundaries and live in the tension
		                of life, particularly fueled by the search for the magis,
		                campfires, slideshows, handstands and good conversation.</a>

		                how we interact with the built environment. During his time at

		                curriculum,” enrolling in courses from Theater Arts to Africana
		                Studies to Engineering. Continuing with that spirit of
		                experimentation and adventure, he took a semester off from
		                school to travel through Morocco and Europe. Danny became
		                interested in technology and design after interning at Warby
		                Parker Eyewear. He followed that experience by joining an
		                academic web design project at Brown and by leading an effort
		                to revamp video production at Brown’s daily newspaper. In his

		                playing basketball in the gym, or more recently, building

		                watching ABC’s Shark Tank, or searching for the perfect Taylor

		                After interning for an investment bank, he discovered two
		                things: he hates working on Wall Street, and he wants to make a
		                legitimate difference in the world. Dylan loves good music
		                festivals, believes in the private sector’s ability to advance

		                Innovation and Social Entrepreneurship. Originally hailing from
		                central Pennsylvania, she was attracted to NOLA by the arts
		                scene, and its role in urban revitalization. Elizabeth has
		                spent a large portion of her time off-campus working with local
		                entrepreneurs, with a strong focus in project development and
		                public relations. She recently interned with Matter Inc., a
		                B-corps product design firm where she researched the issue of
		                endemic violence in New Orleans. While an integral member of
		                campus programming for the entirety of her time at Tulane,
		                Elizabeth currently serves as the co-president of Large
		                Concerts. Her love of New Orleans is rivaled only by her love
		                of travel, having spent a semester in Morocco and backpacking
		                through Northern Africa and Europe. She spends her free time

		                found her passion for cities, design, and policy that led her
		                to serve on the Transportation Board and the economic
		                development board of directors in Chapel Hill. Additional
		                classwork in urban planning and a summer in Louisville,
		                Kentucky working on adaptive reuse of old buildings has made
		                Emily interested in all things in urban development. She is
		                never far from her camera and has served as a photographer and
		                multimedia producer for various groups at UNC, most recently
		                producing video for TEDxUNC. In her spare time, Emily loves to

		                always in search of good Tex-Mex when away from her home state

		                <a>Harrison is a Bay Area native that found himself on the
		                other side of the globe as part of NYU Abu Dhabi’s inaugural
		                class. Aside from his studies in Economics and History, he
		                enjoys reading for leisure, adventures in nature and abroad,
		                and playing capoeira, an Afro-Brazilian fusion of martial arts
		                and dance. His first internship at a fledgling startup sparked
		                an entrepreneurial spirit in him. And last summer, he decided
		                to pair his passion for entrepreneurship with his fascination
		                with technology by going to a web development bootcamp in SF.
		                This entrepreneurial spirit and hacker mentality have already
		                come in handy. At his first hackathon, his team created a
		                SMS-driven service helping small businesses in the MENA region
		                establish a web presence. He also recently wrote a web crawler
		                to collect a dataset from Airbnb for his ongoing senior thesis
		                on the sharing economy.</a>

		                <a>Hetali is a Public Policy and Chemistry major at UNC, and
		                wants to spend the rest of her life helping people understand
		                why science matters to them. All credit for her interest in
		                entrepreneurship and strong attraction to VFA’s mission-driven
		                model goes to four years in Nourish-UNC, a student group that
		                allowed her to start a business and understand the power
		                inherent in communities. She spent summers teaching 9th grade
		                science in Philly with Breakthrough Collaborative, working at
		                USAID through the Washington Leadership Program, and reporting
		                for STEMwire at Reese News Lab. These experiences, along with
		                giving campus tours, dancing with UNC Bhangra Elite and serving
		                on the Young Jains of America board, rounded out four years of
		                building both sides of her brain and perfecting the art of
		                getting to class just barely on time. Hetali loves
		                sci-fi/fantasy literature, sunshine and eating local, and
		                live-tweets (@HetaliLodaya) whenever the occasion calls for
		                it.</a>

		                <a>Jack is an energetic go-getter who has a knack for trying to
		                create the next big thing. His history and economics coursework
		                may have laid the wireframes for success, but his
		                entrepreneurial spirit was sparked while working in business
		                development at SquadUP in New York City. While at Duke, Jack
		                tried his best to leave his mark as he worked with
		                administrators to develop key school policies. Serving as the
		                President of the Interfraternity Council, Jack was also tasked
		                with the job of making sure that the Greek system was all on
		                the same page. Outside of his work for Greek life, Jack enjoys
		                fundraising, playing tennis, and watching scary movies. He
		                couldn’t be more excited to become a VFA Fellow!</a>

		                sailing as often as possible while at home in Wilmington, North

		                <a>At the beginning of his junior year in high school, Jacob
		                Robinson told his father he wanted to get a job. Jacob’s dad
		                told him that he had to start his own business. That’s where
		                Jacob’s interest in entrepreneurship began, and he has been
		                working as a disc jockey ever since. Jacob will graduate from
		                Duke University where is studying public policy. He explored
		                different aspects of public service through internships as a
		                teacher in the Mississippi Delta, volunteer at a microfinance
		                bank in Guatemala, and researcher and fact-checker at Cable
		                News Network (CNN). Jacob believes Venture for America will
		                allow him grow as an entrepreneur, while continuing to work in

		                worked as a social innovation intern for Laboratorio para la

		                socially-responsible entrepreneurial projects after graduation,
		                leading her to Venture for America. At Yale, Johanna has served

		                for British Art, Graphics and Design Editor at the Yale Herald,
		                and Chief Administrative Officer of Kappa Alpha Theta. She

		                <a>Louisa will graduate this June with a degree in Art History

		                Campus Entertainment, the main student-run programming
		                organization, where she enjoyed the challenges of managing the
		                campus’s demands, a large general membership and the fickle
		                needs of professional performers. She also co-led the Junior

		                administrators to identify, train, and lead a class of JAs that
		                works to reinvent the Williams culture with each incoming
		                class. The same passion she has invested in the community at
		                Williams has led her to pursue entrepreneurship and its
		                potential to build and rebuild communities. She and a team of
		                five Williams students recently developed an iPad application
		                to aid a local charter school’s teacher evaluation process.
		                During her summers, her work has centered around marketing and
		                development work for non-profits, where she enjoyed the
		                challenges and rewards of developing relationships between
		                people and worthy causes. In her spare time Louisa loves trail
		                running, feeding her coffee addiction, and anything that can

		                she is studying History, with an Economic Trends concentration,
		                and Leadership. While living abroad in Argentina during her
		                junior year working with a local NGO and representatives from
		                the IMF, Lynsey became particularly interested in tracing
		                economic historical trends relating to changes in the flow of
		                capital and the spread of technological innovations. Prior to
		                that, she assisted the California Governor’s Office in its
		                attempts to coordinate the efforts of the private, public, and
		                not-for-profit sectors in advancing developments in alternative
		                energy sources throughout the state. She also gained exposure
		                to the policy hub of Washington, DC, where she assisted a
		                lobbying firm in the international trade arena. Lynsey
		                co-founded and helped establish two social entrepreneurial
		                startups focused on leveraging and increasing the engagement of
		                her local community, including the first student-run
		                microfinance institution in California. She is excited to
		                witness the expanding intersection of the private sector and
		                economic community development as a VFA Fellow. In her free
		                time, Lynsey enjoys classic formula one racing and debating
		                policy effectiveness, preferably at the same time.</a>

		                <a>Sean is pursuing a degree in Economics and Finance at Loyola
		                University, New Orleans, and has fallen in love with the
		                Crescent City after leaving his hometown in beautiful central
		                Kentucky. He has been an active leader on his campus and has
		                served as both a member of student government and as President
		                of his fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi. During his time at Loyola, he
		                also helped co-found an entrepreneur association open to
		                members of Loyola’s student body. By immersing himself into the
		                New Orleans start-up scene, Sean has secured several important
		                roles with early-stage companies in the city. During his senior
		                year, he helped grow and develop Holomua Life Learning, a
		                social non-profit working to alleviate financial illiteracy in
		                New Orleans, and interned with 52businesses. Beginning March
		                2014, the 52businesses team will start a new business every
		                week for a year and will work to show the accessibility of
		                entrepreneurship and demystify the process of pursuing a

		                <a>Seun has come to realize the importance of culture in any
		                social setting, and he strives to understand its impact on
		                interactions amongst peers and between communities. With such
		                an interest, Seun has made it practice to seek solutions
		                through personal projects for different cultural voids in
		                communities that he has been a part of. He has built and
		                sustained theINcrowd, his own online publication, that explored
		                subcultural interests in urban millennial communities, and
		                brought a diverse crowd of movers and shakers together through
		                concerts, meet and greets, and competitions. Beyond that, Seun
		                spent his Junior and Senior year of college cultivating a
		                mobile application known as We Are The Loop that served as a
		                platform for DC area college students to venture and learn more
		                about the Washingtonian capitol through a catalog of different
		                events. On the professional end, he has acquired a developing
		                skillset in business logistics and operations, account
		                management, strategy and content creation through his extensive
		                work with the now renowned Trillectro Music Festival and the
		                digital strategy agency Prolific Interactive. Graduating from
		                the Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University
		                this spring, Seun intends to combine his interests in
		                cross-cultural interaction, community building, and innovation
		                in an effort to discover the best practices for developing
		                social capital in different societies, domestic and abroad.</a>

		                <a>Originally from Peachtree City, Georgia, Timothy will
		                graduate from the University of Virginia where he studied
		                Architecture, Global Sustainability, and Urban &amp;
		                Environmental Planning. In 2012, his fascination with the
		                intersection of design, the environment, and community vitality
		                took him to Limpopo, South Africa, where he had the opportunity
		                to work with Studio reCOVER, an initiative which embraces the
		                humanitarian potential of cross-disciplinary research and
		                design. Supplementing this experience with skills gleaned as a
		                more traditional architecture intern, Timothy hopes to couple
		                entrepreneurship and environmental design to leverage community
		                development and revitalize post-industrial American cities.
		                Outside of the architecture studio, he devoted much of his
		                college career to Residence Life, Student Council, and his
		                Honor Fraternity. In his free time, “T,” as he’s known by most,
		                is a big fan of karaoke, trivia, graphic design, and
		                geocaching.</a>

		                University in St. Louis. Throughout his academic and early
		                professional career, Zach has showcased his entrepreneurial
		                spirit and willingness to take risks. His summers have allowed
		                for such distinct experiences as conducting archaeological
		                fieldwork in Kazakhstan’s Dzhungar Mountains and working as a
		                legal clerk in the Medical Division of the Illinois Office of
		                the Attorney General. In the latter capacity, Zach’s
		                responsibilities ranged from coordinating expert witness
		                statements to providing council with analyses regarding the
		                current scientific literature on Shaken Baby Syndrome. He has
		                additionally demonstrated his propensity to take initiative via
		                the co-founding of the Washington University Butter Churning
		                Society, an organization centered on philanthropy and building
		                a sense of community that is unlike any other student group in
		                the nation. Zach’s personal time is split between working to
		                grow his own startup venture, which has developed a mobile
		                studying application that trains users to achieve optimal
		                levels of brain activity when addressing academic tasks,
		                following Chicago’s sports teams, discovering new music, and
		                building meaningful relationships with bright and unique
		                individuals, as he looks forward to doing with his peers in the
		                VFA Class of 2014.</a>
